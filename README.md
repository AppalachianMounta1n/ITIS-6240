## AES Implementation - Due 2/9/2024
The base file [aesO.c](https://github.com/AppalachianMounta1n/ITIS-6240-Projects/blob/main/AES%20Implementation/aesO.c) was provided by the professor, Dr. Yongge Wang. The updated file [aesO-Efficient.c](https://github.com/AppalachianMounta1n/ITIS-6240-Projects/blob/main/AES%20Implementation/aesO%20-%20Efficient.c) is the project file where our code is being updated to optimize the performance of the original program.

### Relevant Files
- [aesO.c](https://github.com/AppalachianMounta1n/ITIS-6240-Projects/blob/main/AES%20Implementation/aesO.c)
